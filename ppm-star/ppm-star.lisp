;;;; DESCRIPTION 
;;;;
;;;;   Implements the construction of a PPM* finite-context model
;;;;   following the suffix-tree implementation described by Bunton
;;;;   (1996) and using Ukkonen's (1995) online left-to-right suffix
;;;;   tree construction algorithm. The construction of generalised 
;;;;   suffix trees is supported using the the sentinel symbol, $. 
;;;;   Printing model trees to postscript is supported via the 
;;;;   PSGRAPH package. 
;;;;
;;;; TODO 
;;;;
;;;;   - Bunton improvements: state-selection;
;;;;   - Other smoothing techniques (Kneser-Ney, Katz); 
;;;;   - Other modelling techniques (PST, LZ, BW, DMC).
